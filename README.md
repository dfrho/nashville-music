# Nashville Live Music Video Log

This repository contains the source code for a Next.js web application that displays a log of live music performances in Nashville, TN. The log features videos of performances by various artists and bands, as well as information about the venues and events.

The application uses a GraphQL API to retrieve data from Hygraph's Headless CMS, which serves as the content management system for the log. The application is deployed and hosted on Netlify, a cloud computing platform that offers web hosting and serverless backend services.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, you can clone the repository to your local machine and run the following commands:


This will install the required dependencies and start the development server. You can then open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Technology Stack

The application is built using the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - a React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) - a query language and runtime for APIs that provides a more efficient and flexible alternative to REST APIs. Very easy to request and drop data in from any backend.
- [Hygraph Headless CMS](https://hygraph.io/) - a federated GraphQL API-powered headless content management system that makes building and running a content-driven application seamless for frontend engineers and product/UI teams.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - a cloud computing platform that provides web hosting, serverless functions, CI/CD and innovations like branch deployment for easy approvals.

## Work in Progress

Expect enhancements to get all tags functionality and cleaning up the hard-coded content functionality. We are essentially unconnecting the mdx blog posts and housing and creating them in Hygraph, making this a product that can be run by non-coders after initial launch.
